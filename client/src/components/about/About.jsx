          <p>Hello there!</p>
          <p>
            We are Calgary Laughter Yoga, an inclusive group of folks from different walks of life with a passion for laughter and wellbeing. We want to ensure you feel welcome here and connect with our vibe!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our club has been running since 2013 in various spaces around Calgary. We started when three of us met at a laughter conference in Vancouver. Knowing that we all bring different strengths to the team, with a shared vision for joy, health and community, we joined forces and are building something stronger and better together than what we could have done on our own.

          <p>We have a free Laughter Club open to all ages and abilities and we meet on Sundays at 5pm Mountain Time, currently on Zoom. That's right - you can join us, for free, from the comfort of your own home!</p>
          <p>
            When we meet in-person, we rent out space that is accessible so whether you are in a wheelchair, walk fast or slow, a marathon runner, a billionaire, or barely getting by, you are welcome to join us. Our favourite venue is the <a href="https://www.insideouttheatre.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">Inside Out Theatre</a> as it aligns with our values and is a fabulous space in the heart of downtown. You may find us around the city filling other spaces with joy and laughter as well! Please check the Events Calendar on the <a href="../hero.js" class="underline" target="_blank">Home Page</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/calgarylaughteryoga" class="underline" target="_blank">Facebook</a> for updated in-person events.

            In the spirit of respect, reciprocity and truth, we honour those who have come before us and acknowledge the traditional territories and oral practices of the Blackfoot (Siksika, Piikani, and Kainai), the Tsuutâ€™ina (Sarcee), the Stoney Nakoda First Nations, the MÃ©tis Nation (Region 3), and all people who make their homes in the Treaty 7 region of Southern Alberta.
